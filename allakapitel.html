            <h5>CHAPTER ONE</h5>
            
            <span class=" mer">
               The Clans existence has been shown since the 6th century, but they were well established by the 11th and 12th century. A long time ago in Scotland they used a language called Gaelic. The word clan comes from the Gaelic word ”clann” which means family, children. Those words still represent what a clan is, a large family unit.  The original clans started off to be large families because the majority of the members were related to each other by blood. Every clan had a chief who represented the clan. In the early years the clan chief was supposed the lead the clan into battles and also be a political influencer. Nowadays, the chief is no more than a high social dignity.  The clans also contained some “septs”, which were families who were associated with the clan chief but not bound to him by blood, but they saw the chief as their head and leader. There were also people who joined the clan just for protection or to show the clan support.
               <br><br>
               It all began when the Romans left Britain and Scotland was populated by a few distinct races. The first race were the picts, they were mysterious people who occupied the highlands of Scotland. Settled in Strathclyde were the Britons who had come from England along with the Saxons who lived in the southeast. In the area of Galloway and Argyll lived The Attacotti people. Evidence of more tribal divisions began in the Kingdom of Dalriada. People has always wanted to seek safety through numbers and find some kind of social harmony. These tribe-systems in time became “the Scottish clans”.
               <br><br>
            
               Many clans claimed that their clan had mythological founders to give them more status and to give their origins a more glorified history. The most powerful clans gave themselves origins based on Celtic mythology. For example, there have been claims that the Clan Campbell had claimed that they were descended from Diarmid the Fingalian hero in the 13th century. Diarmid was a hero because he battled and slew the fierce Wild Boar that terrorized the village he lived in.
               <br><br>
               Some Clans descend from the same family, like the Clans Mackinnon and Gregor. Only one group of clans can trace back in time and find their ancestry, Niall of the Nine Hostages who were the High King of Ireland. The clans who descend from Niall of the Nine Hostages is Clan Sweeney, Clan Lamont, Clan Maclea, Clan MacLachlan and Clan MacNeill. However, the emergence of clans had a lot more to do with political statements than ethnicity. 
               <br><br>
               Off course every clan had a name, the name is tied to an area in Scotland where the clan lived, also known as “clan territories”. If the chief of a clan decided to expand the territory, the new people, who swore him allegiance often took the clan name. The history of clans is pretty complex and interwoven and finding out which clan you belong to can be really hard.  The clans lived off the land and each individual clan was bound together and developed own laws, traditions and customs (I’ll write more about that later).  The main source of wealth was the clan’s cattle, along with border disputes. Every clan had their own territory and protected it against other clans who wished to harm them. Throughout Scottish history there has been many battles between clans and there still is some rivalry between them.  To be a part of a clan is something Scottish people are very proud of.

             <h5>CHAPTER TWO</h5>
             <span class="mer">
                In this chapter I’ll bring up the structure of a clan. There are two types of clan concepts but they work and function as one.
            
                
                <br><br>
                As I mentioned before, the head of the clan is the Chief (Dighreachd) he is the leader, lawgiver and owner of the clan’s land. The chief’s succession is chosen from a group of individuals who all have hereditary claims. This group mostly consists of men, whose great grandfathers had been chiefs themselves. This system of the succession is called “Tanistry”. The chief had to choose one of these males as a heir or “tanist”. The tanistry system made sure that the second chief were to be strong. The tanist were supposed to be a second commander and also take full responsibility of the clan during the chief’s absence. 
                <br><br>

                The tanist then choose the chieftains, who were beneath the chief but head of the individual houses/branches that formed the clan. The      eldest     the chieftains was called the “Toiseach” and he often became the Tanist. 
                We then have the Gentlemen, who could claim that they had blood ties to the chief. The gentlemen were also called “Daoin-Uaisle” and beneath them were the rest of the clan. The last part of a clan was the clansmen, they did the manual work in times of peace, but in times of war, they fought for their chief.
                <br><br>
            
                In the Highlands which had been the homeland of the picts, who I mentioned earlier, there were seven tribal districts or provinces. 
                A tribal unit was called a “Tuath” and several Tuaths together was called a “Mortuadh”. If there were two or more of these Mortuadhs, they made up the “Coicidh” or province. If Coicidhs joined together they each donated some land and that land made up the central district in which their capital was located. For example; The place where the four Perthshire provinces joined lies the palace of Scone.

            <h5>CHAPTER THREE</h5>
            <span class="mer">
                 The Mackenzie clan is very famous and in this chapter I will dig a bit deeper into this clan.
            
                <img id="clan" src="http://www.greatscottishclans.com/clans/images/clan_mackenzie.gif" alt="clan mackenzie"> 
                <br><br>
                Let's start with the name, Mackenzie. The name is of scottish origin and rises from Gaelic. Mackenzie is an anglicised form of the Gaelic Mac Coinnich, which is a form of the personal name Coinneach. Today the name Coinneach is generally anglicised as Kenneth.  The mackenzie clan is sometimes called Kenneth. 
                The clans territory was rather large and the chief's of the mackenzies lead the 4th most powerful clan in Scotland. 
                Unfortunately, the clan chief Francis Mackenzie Humberston died in 1815 and with his death, the direct male line of the Mackenzie chiefs became   extinct. 
                In 1979 Roderick Grant Francis Blunt-Mackenzie, the 4th Earl of Cromartie changed is surname til Mackenzie and then became chief by the Lord Lyon King of Arms. Today's chief is the fifth Earl, John Ruaridh Grant Mackenzie (in 2003, John actually lived in castle Leod, fascinating).
                
                <br><br>
                Eilean Donan Castle on Loch Duich in Kintail was the first castle to be associated with the Mackenzie clan. Eilean Donan was where it all began in the late 13th century when Coineach MacCoineach - Kenneth son of Kenneth - gave his name to the clan: the name means son of the fair one in Gaelic. Later, the power of the clan moved to the east and to Brahan castle. Sadly, the castle did not survive World War Two. So now, the home for the Mackenzie clan's chief is within castle Leod. 
                Here is a picture of castle Brahan. 
                
                <br><br>
                This clan's history is long and there is tons of information about it online. I am not going to write about that, because I don't think it will be interesting to read about and like I said, Their history is long… So I hope you found this chapter interesting anyway and that you  learned some from it.
