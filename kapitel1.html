          <h5>CHAPTER ONE</h5>
            
               <p>The Clans existence has been shown since the 6th century, but they were well established by the 11th and 12th century. A long time ago in Scotland they used a language called Gaelic. The word clan comes from the Gaelic word ”clann” which means family, children. Those words still represent what a clan is, a large family unit.  The original clans started off to be large families because the majority of the members were related to each other by blood. Every clan had a chief who represented the clan. In the early years the clan chief was supposed the lead the clan into battles and also be a political influencer. Nowadays, the chief is no more than a high social dignity.  The clans also contained some “septs”, which were families who were associated with the clan chief but not bound to him by blood, but they saw the chief as their head and leader. There were also people who joined the clan just for protection or to show the clan support. </p>
            
               <p>It all began when the Romans left Britain and Scotland was populated by a few distinct races. The first race were the picts, they were mysterious people who occupied the highlands of Scotland. Settled in Strathclyde were the Britons who had come from England along with the Saxons who lived in the southeast. In the area of Galloway and Argyll lived The Attacotti people. Evidence of more tribal divisions began in the Kingdom of Dalriada. People has always wanted to seek safety through numbers and find some kind of social harmony. These tribe-systems in time became “the Scottish clans”.</p>
            
               <p>Many clans claimed that their clan had mythological founders to give them more status and to give their origins a more glorified history. The most powerful clans gave themselves origins based on Celtic mythology. For example, there have been claims that the Clan Campbell had claimed that they were descended from Diarmid the Fingalian hero in the 13th century. Diarmid was a hero because he battled and slew the fierce Wild Boar that terrorized the village he lived in. </p>
            
               <p>Some Clans descend from the same family, like the Clans Mackinnon and Gregor. Only one group of clans can trace back in time and find their ancestry, Niall of the Nine Hostages who were the High King of Ireland. The clans who descend from Niall of the Nine Hostages is Clan Sweeney, Clan Lamont, Clan Maclea, Clan MacLachlan and Clan MacNeill. However, the emergence of clans had a lot more to do with political statements than ethnicity. </p>
            
               <p>Off course every clan had a name, the name is tied to an area in Scotland where the clan lived, also known as “clan territories”. If the chief of a clan decided to expand the territory, the new people, who swore him allegiance often took the clan name. The history of clans is pretty complex and interwoven and finding out which clan you belong to can be really hard.  The clans lived off the land and each individual clan was bound together and developed own laws, traditions and customs (I’ll write more about that later).  The main source of wealth was the clan’s cattle, along with border disputes. Every clan had their own territory and protected it against other clans who wished to harm them. Throughout Scottish history there has been many battles between clans and there still is some rivalry between them.  To be a part of a clan is something Scottish people are very proud of. </p>
