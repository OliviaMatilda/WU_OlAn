          <h5>CHAPTER TWO</h5>
                <p>In this chapter I’ll bring up the structure of a clan. There are two types of clan concepts but they work and function as one.</p>

                <p>
                <img  id="chief" src="http://www.scotclans.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Forbes_rrMcIan_img.jpg" alt="Chief">
                As I mentioned before, the head of the clan is the Chief (Dighreachd) he is the leader, lawgiver and owner of the clan’s land. The chief’s succession is chosen from a group of individuals who all have hereditary claims. This group mostly consists of men, whose great grandfathers had been chiefs themselves. This system of the succession is called “Tanistry”. The chief had to choose one of these males as a heir or “tanist”. The tanistry system made sure that the second chief were to be strong. The tanist were supposed to be a second commander and also take full responsibility of the clan during the chief’s absence.
                </p>

                <p>The tanist then choose the chieftains, who were beneath the chief but head of the individual houses/branches that formed the clan. The eldest of the chieftains was called the “Toiseach” and he often became the Tanist. 
                We then have the Gentlemen, who could claim that they had blood ties to the chief. The gentlemen were also called “Daoin-Uaisle” and beneath them were the rest of the clan. The last part of a clan was the clansmen, they did the manual work in times of peace, but in times of war, they fought for their chief.</p>

                <p>In the Highlands which had been the homeland of the picts, who I mentioned earlier, there were seven tribal districts or provinces. 
                A tribal unit was called a “Tuath” and several Tuaths together was called a “Mortuadh”. If there were two or more of these Mortuadhs, they made up the “Coicidh” or province. If Coicidhs joined together they each donated some land and that land made up the central district in which their capital was located. For example; The place where the four Perthshire provinces joined lies the palace of Scone.</p>
